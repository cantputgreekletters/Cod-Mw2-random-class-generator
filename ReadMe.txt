INFO:
This is a really early build. The game normaly contains much more weapons and other features I can add randomness to.
In this really early stage of the program, the program can only generate a random AR (Assault Rifle).
I plan on adding all guns and maybe "Perks" too.

HOW TO RUN:
First of all, you need all of the three python files that are included.
For the program to work, you need to run the "main.py" file and only that.
To quit the program you need to close the terminal in which it is running on.

WHAT TO DO:
After installing and testing, I'd love to get some feedback on the program and suggestions.
You may alter the code freely but if you can, please inform me!



Thank you for your time!
